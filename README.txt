My Personal Portfolio

This project is my first personal portfolio website made with HTML and CSS.
This is just a very basic version of what could be for when I eventually level up
my skills as a web developer.

Attached with this portfolio are the 4 other files including this README.txt file. Those being 
my personal image JPG(to be able to see it as I didn't upload the photo to any site servers), the
time table html file as a another page to the site view my university schedule. And a CSS file for 
the main html document.


Assignment1.html
The <head> contains a reference to the css style sheet and a script to link the icons that I used in the bio.
The css stylesheet associated with this html file is "assignment1.css".

Then we go on to the body where there's 2 seperate containers which are divs nested in another div.
The first holds the header, opening bio, email, and an image source.

The header utilizes nav and lists to hold it's content. It is then stylized using flex box.
Flex is specifically applied to the list in nav to lay it out nicely.
The nav lists includes three buttons with anchor tags; to home, to more background information further down on the page, and a final one linked to my schedule.
Next, the main bio contains the icons of my social medias (Albiet most I don't have right besides Instagram) and a first impression of myself and is using position to position itself near the center.
Below the bio, is my business email address that I use for now. Beside both is a personal image of myself sized to fit on the page. All 3 of these elements are positioned using the position keyword.

The second container called "container2" contains extra information about me and is where the anchor link from the 'background information' in nav leads to.
This container uses flex box again for layout.
There's 3 parts to this container; my educational background, skills, and hobbies each in their own div as that allows me to use flex for a good layout.

timeTableAssign.html
When you click on "My Schedule" in the header, it'll take you to my time table for university
This is just a very basic version of a time table that utilizes the <table> keyword and is stylized with internal css to differentiate from the main document
